Exercise02. Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off speed v, you can compute
the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to take off using the following
formula:
Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the
acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s2), and displays the minimum runway
length.
